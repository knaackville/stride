 * Which colour the track floor is painted on which lap.

 * that a finished lap's colour *becomes* the track, and the next lap paints the next colour over
 * it, cycling forever.
 *
 * Tested here for the reason [LapTracker]'s own doc gives: this is pure arithmetic over a lap
 * counter, and the alternative to a JVM test is a rider on a treadmill counting to five and
 * squinting. The off-by-one is the whole risk. [LapTracker] hands out 1 for the first lap, not 0,
 * so a palette indexed straight off the lap number is one entry ahead of where it should be — and
