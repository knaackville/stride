/**
 * Following the console when the rider drives it from the machine's own buttons.
 *
 * Stride is not the only thing that can stop this belt: there is a Stop button under the rider's
 * hand, and pressing it used to leave the overlay counting a workout that had visibly ended —
 * "Pause workout" over a stationary belt, which is the same wrong screen the start handshake was
 * reworked to remove, arrived at from the other direction.
 *
 * The hazard in fixing it is the opposite mistake, and these tests are mostly about that: a rule
 * that pauses whenever the console says it is not moving would pause every workout a second after
 * it began, because Stride confirms a start as soon as the command is accepted and the console keeps
 * reporting IDLE while the belt spins up.
