/**
 * S3 + S10 spike: overlay windows and the edge-swipe gesture layer.
 *
 * Deliberately built from native Android views, not a second Flutter engine. S8 decides whether
 * Flutter is fast enough on this SoC for the always-visible strip; until then, native keeps the
 * spike honest about what the window mechanics can do.
 *
 * Three window types are used, because FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE is a whole-window flag - you cannot have
 * inert regions inside a single touchable window (this was a mistake in revision 1 of the plan):
 *
 *  1. Edge rails      - separate touchable windows at the left, right, top, and bottom edges.
 *  2. Edge strips     - thin, touchable, capture the start of an edge swipe.
 *  3. Handle tab      - the always-present bottom-center recovery affordance.
 *
 * THESIS: Stride is an edge-only workout console that refuses to cover the media surface or imply
 * treadmill authority. OWN-WORLD: near-black rounded slabs, amber incline language, cyan speed
 * language, and blunt locked states. STORY: the runner sees one honest timer, unknown machine
 * metrics, working media volume, and clear instructions to use the console/safety key for the belt.
 * FIRST VIEWPORT: a top floating metrics pill, left incline rail, right speed rail, bottom action bar,
 * and no center window at all. FORM: iFit's edge information architecture translated into Stride's
 * safety-first glass console.

     * escalates here rather than to "stopped". Everything about this card is chosen against that
     * sentence:

     * - **No scrim dismiss and no "Not now".** Every other card closes on a tap anywhere, which is

     * - **Red, not the amber every other card uses.** This is not a thing that went wrong with the
     *   app. It is a thing that may be wrong with the treadmill.
     * - **It says what failed before it says what to do.** "The console never accepted the stop"
     *   and "the console accepted it and the belt is still moving" are the same verdict and very
     *   different things to be standing next to.
     *
     * It is drawn in the fix-it layer, above the chrome, so it cannot occlude the pinned stop
     * control — the hazard table's "navigation panel or edge gesture hides the stop control while

 * lights up, the rail window is created at its full 132×722, and there is nothing inside it.

 * `ControlList`. Treating that as the machine's final word left both rails permanently blank on a
 * console that was working perfectly.

 * list has no usable controls, the fallback still gives the rider an honest column. An invalid empty

 *
 * Returns null when the tap is an ordinary pick, which is the common case and the safe default:
 *
 *  - nothing was tapped before, or not recently enough ([windowMs]);
 *  - the first tap was not a whole number, so there is no digit to extend — a machine that
 *    publishes 7.5 as a preset is choosing its own steps and should not have them re-typed;
 *  - the second tap is not a single digit, because "12" cannot be a tenths place.
 *  - the composed value falls outside [minimumAllowed]..[maximumAllowed], in which case the second
 *    tap remains an ordinary independent pick.
 *
 * The sign of the first value is kept and the magnitude grows, so on an incline column -2 then 5
 * reads as -2.5, which is how it would be typed and how it would be read back.
 *
 * Deliberately pure: this decides what a treadmill is asked to do, from two taps whose meaning
 * depends on a clock, and every branch of it should be checkable without a treadmill.
