/**
 * What colour the track floor is painted, and how that advances with the lap count.
 *
 * ### Why this is a file of its own
 *
 * The same reason [TrackGeometry] is. The track floor's two questions are "where is the lane" and
 * "what colour is it", and both used to be answered inside an Android `View` where
 * neither could be checked without a treadmill. Where lives in [TrackGeometry]; what colour lives
 * here. Nothing in this file imports Android, so the arithmetic that decides which lap gets which
 * colour is a JVM unit test rather than a rider squinting at a console on their fifth lap.
 *
 * ### The behaviour it exists to produce
 *
 * A lap used to end by *erasing* itself: [TrackFloorView]'s progress band grows from the start line
 * to the runner, and at the lap boundary progress wraps to zero, so the band collapsed and the plain
 * lane colour came back. Four hundred metres of work vanished in one frame.
 *
 * Instead the loop keeps what it earned. The colour lap N was filled with *becomes* the base colour
 * of the track, and lap N+1 paints the next colour over it. So for lap `L`:
 *
 * ```
 * band(L) = painted[(L - 1) mod size]   // what this lap is painting now
 * lane(L) = painted[(L - 2) mod size]   // what the lap before it left behind
 * ```
 *
 * with lap 1 the one exception: nothing has been painted yet, so its lane is [UNPAINTED]. That makes
 * lap 1 pixel-for-pixel what the track looked like before this existed — the indigo lane with the
 * teal band growing across it — and every lap after it a rotation of the same picture.
 *
 * ### Why the alphas are what they are
 *
 * `TrackFloorView.buildLaneShaders` draws lane and band as *mutually exclusive* regions, so the
 * completed part of the loop is one fill rather than band-composited-over-lane. [PAINTED_ALPHAS] is
 * therefore the alpha that composite used to produce (`1 - (1-lane)(1-band)` at each stop), which is
 * what keeps the loop from visibly thinning at the exact moment a lap rolls over — the failure this
 * whole change exists to remove, in a subtler form.
 *
 * Every entry keeps the gradient *shape* the original two had, and for the reason
 * `TrackFloorView.buildLaneShaders` gives: translucent, brightest toward the bottom of the screen,
 * so the top of the loop sinks into whatever is playing underneath and the ring reads as ground
 * rather than as plastic lying on the glass.
