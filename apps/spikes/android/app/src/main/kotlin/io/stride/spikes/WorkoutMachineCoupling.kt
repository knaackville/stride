 * without any of those three knowing about the others.
 *
 * Every command goes through [MachineCoordinator]. Nothing here talks to the machine directly.
 *

 * this one decides whether Stride shuts a rider's fan down and moves their deck, and every branch
 * of it has to be checkable without a treadmill.
 *
 * ## The distinction this exists to make
 *
 * Three different things used to arrive here as the same transition, and only one of them is an
 * end:
 *
 * - **A pause** is [WorkoutSession.State.PAUSED]. It is resumable — the rider stepped off, the belt
 *   is expected to move again, and the console's own Stop button is adopted as one too
 *   ([observeConsole]). Shutting the fan down or flattening the deck here would be Stride deciding
 *   their session is over on their behalf. It gets [NOTHING] from this function; the existing pause
 *   command is issued elsewhere.
 * - **An abandoned start** is [WorkoutSession.Ending.ABANDONED]: a start the machine refused, the
 *   rider cancelled, or the watchdog gave up on. It gets [STOP] — exactly what it got before — and
 *   deliberately no more. It is the retry path (`retryStart`), `WorkoutSession.abandon` keeps the
 *   goal precisely because it is "not a workout they completed", and the settling writes cost round
 *   trips on the one path where a rider is standing on a belt waiting to be told whether their
 *   start worked. Nothing established the belt ever moved, so there is no known-safe state to
 *   return the deck to.
 * - **An ended workout** is [WorkoutSession.Ending.ENDED]: the rider pressed End. That is a
 *   deliberate, final, non-resumable action, and it is the one that gets [STOP_AND_SETTLE].
 *
 * ## Why an end arrives as STOPPING and an abandon as IDLE
 *
 * Issue #39. `WorkoutSession.stop` now lands in [WorkoutSession.State.STOPPING] rather than
 * publishing IDLE over a belt nothing has confirmed stopped, so an *end* reaches this function as a
 * transition into STOPPING. An abandon still goes straight to IDLE, because holding the retry path
 * behind a confirmation would lock a rider out of pressing Start again while they stand on a
 * treadmill wondering whether it is about to move.
 *
 * The settle that follows a stop is `STOPPING → IDLE` and asks for nothing: the stop it is settling
 * has already gone out, and re-sending anything here would be this function commanding a machine
 * for a workout that ended seconds ago.
 *
 * A transition that is already IDLE asks for nothing either: `WorkoutSession.stop` and `abandon`
 * both no-op from IDLE and never reach a listener, so this is belt and braces against a duplicate.

 *
 * ## Why an edge and not a level
 *
 * The obvious rule — "the console says it is not moving, so pause" — pauses every workout about a
 * second after it starts. Stride confirms a start the moment the machine accepts the command, and
 * the console spends the next poll or two still reporting IDLE while the belt spins up. A level test
 * fires in that gap, every single time.
 *
 * An edge only fires when the console has told us it was moving and has since told us it is not,
 * which is what pressing Stop on the machine looks like from here and is not what a start looks
 * like. [previous] being null — nothing known yet, or the link dropped and cleared it — is therefore
 * never an edge.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * A console that starts moving while Stride is IDLE does not begin a session. Adopting a workout the
 * rider started on the machine raises questions this cannot answer on its own — whose goal, whose
 * clock, whether the media should start — and quietly starting one from a poll is not the way to
 * settle them. Only a session Stride is already holding is followed.
