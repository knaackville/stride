/**
 * The Stride app store: a background service that keeps the console's software current without a
 * laptop.
 *
 * It does four things, in this order, and nothing else:
 *
 * 1. Fetches the catalog ([CatalogManifest]) over HTTPS.
 * 2. Classifies it against what is installed ([UpdatePlan]).
 * 3. Downloads and verifies stale third-party artifacts ([ApkDownloader], [ApkVerifier]).
 * 4. Asks [ApkInstaller] to install them, user-confirmed.
 *
 * ### Why it is a service and not a Dart timer
 *
 * The same reason the overlay is (`PLAN.md` section 3.2): the Flutter engine dies whenever the rider
 * is inside Spotify, which is most of the time. Update checking that only runs while Stride is
 * foregrounded would never run on the machine it exists to maintain.
 *
 * ### Safety
 *
 * - **No install prompt while the belt is not idle.** A `PackageInstaller` confirmation is a
 *   full-screen activity; it would cover the stop control (`PLAN.md` section 3.9). Downloads are
 *   unrestricted — they draw nothing — but the install step waits for [WorkoutSession.State.IDLE].
 *   Work held this way resumes automatically when the session ends.
 * - **Stride never updates itself unprompted.** A self-install kills this process, and with it the
 *   overlay that supplies the only Back/Home the console has. [ACTION_INSTALL] on Stride's own
 *   package is only ever reached from an explicit tap in the launcher.
 * - **No motor path.** This class has no reference to the machine link and never will. It reads
 *   workout *state* to decide when to stay quiet; it cannot start, stop, or change anything
 *   physical.

     * [Context.startForegroundService] for you, `startForeground()` must run within ten seconds".
     * Miss that and `ActiveServices` brings the record down with its `fgRequired` flag still set,
     * which throws `RemoteServiceException` on our *main* thread - a fatal crash of the launcher,
     * caused by a background update check. See [ForegroundStart], which is where that promise is
     * avoided in the first place.
     *
     * Two consequences are baked in here:
     *
     * - **It never throws.** An exception escaping `onCreate` is not caught by anything useful; it
     *   becomes `RuntimeException: Unable to create service`, a *different* fatal crash, and one
     *   that also leaves the promise unanswered. A boolean lets the caller decide.
