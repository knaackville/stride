/**
 * The centrepiece of the NordicTrack/iFit stock treadmill workout screen: a running track drawn as
 * an oval seen from directly overhead, lying flat like a floor, with a marker showing where the
 * runner currently is around the lap.
 *
 * ### The geometry
 *
 * Where the track *is* lives in [TrackGeometry]: a genuine ground plane with a constant-width lane
 * and a solved fit onto whatever box this view is given, drawn without a camera rather than as a
 * squashed 2D ellipse. That is the half of this surface that can be checked without a treadmill, so
 * it is kept separate and unit-tested. This class is the other half: what colour it all is.
 *
 * ### Cost
 *
 * Everything that only depends on size is computed once in [rebuildGeometry]: the sample tables,
 * the lane path, the lane markings, the start line, the shaders and the label metrics. [onDraw]
 * allocates nothing; it walks cached arrays and reuses instance Paints, Paths and Shaders, because
 * the host redraws this view on a poll of its own and animates the marker between those redraws —
 * see [applyProgress].
 */

     * see how far you have run" and "you have run nothing" are different claims and a marker parked
     * on the start line makes the second one.
     *
     * Successive known values are animated rather than jumped, because a marker that teleports every
     * time a fresh reading lands reads as broken. The animation runs over however long it has
     * actually been since the last one — see [progressAnimDurationMs] — rather than assuming a fixed
     * cadence: the host's own poll of the distance register slows down whenever the console's state
     * string briefly is not one it recognises as definitely moving (see `MachineLink`'s poll
     * scheduler), which used to show up here as the marker holding still for a beat and then racing
     * through a whole poll interval's worth of distance in a fixed one-second burst to catch up. A
     * jump of more than [SNAP_FRACTION] of a lap is treated as a seek or a new session and lands
     * immediately regardless.
